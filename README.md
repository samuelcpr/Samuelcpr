Graduated and at the beginning of my career, I'm passionate about technology and development, my recent experience made me a great JavaScript enthusiast, especially React, for me it's fantastic what these amazing technologies allow to do, and I know this is just the beginning, I love it study, learn new things and share knowledge. I have great affinity with agile methodologies that allow us to do all this in team esprints, and transform all this into value for the company and customers. I am driven by challenges and looking forward to new opportunities, in order to grow and be able to deliver more quality products and technical excellence every day. ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·
